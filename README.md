# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# ***Lottery***
- We are given Lottery tickets with a 3 digit number
- The number is generated randomly
- if the sum of all digits is 15, we win the lottery and get the prize

[4 , 2 , 4]

[***G***](https://github.dev/facebook/react/blob/main/)

Both implementations of the `genTicket` function generate an array of random numbers between 1 and 9, but they do so using different methods. comparing the two approaches:

### 1. **First Implementation**:

```js
function genTicket(n) {
    let generateTic = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1);
    return generateTic;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **`Array(n).fill(0)`**: Creates an array with `n` elements, all initialized to `0`. For example, if `n = 3`, it creates `[0, 0, 0]`.
- **`.map(() => Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1)`**: Transforms each element of the array using the provided function. This function generates a random number between 1 and 9 for each element of the array.
  - `Math.random()` generates a floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
  - `Math.random() * 9` scales it to between 0 and 9.
  - `Math.floor()` rounds it down to the nearest integer (0 through 8).
  - Adding `1` shifts the range to 1 through 9.
- **Result**: An array with `n` random numbers between 1 and 9.

### 2. **Second Implementation**:

```js
function genTicket(n) {
  let arr = new Array(n); // Creates an array of size n with undefined elements.
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1;
  }
  return arr;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **`new Array(n)`**: Creates an array with `n` empty slots (undefined elements). For example, if `n = 3`, it creates `[undefined, undefined, undefined]`.
- **`for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) { arr[i] = ... }`**: Loops through each index of the array and assigns a random number between 1 and 9 to each slot.
  - Inside the loop, the random number is generated and assigned to each index `i`.
- **Result**: An array with `n` random numbers between 1 and 9.

### Comparison:
- **Effectiveness**: Both implementations generate an array with `n` random numbers between 1 and 9.
- **Performance**: Both are quite efficient, but the first approach is more concise and uses modern JavaScript methods (`Array.fill()` and `map()`), which are often preferred for their readability and functional style.
- **Initialization**: 
  - The first approach initializes the array with `0` values and then uses `.map()` to replace these values with random numbers.
  - The second approach uses a `for` loop to directly assign random numbers to each index of an initially undefined array.

### Correcting the First Implementation:

The `Array(3).fill(0)` part of the first function is not affected by the `n` parameter. To use `n`, you should modify it as follows:

```js
function genTicket(n) {
    let generateTic = Array(n).fill(0).map(() => Math.floor(Math.random() * 9) + 1);
    return generateTic;
}
```

### Conclusion:
Both functions will work, but the first implementation (using `Array.fill()` and `map()`) is more concise and leverages modern JavaScript features. The second implementation (using a `for` loop) is more traditional but equally effective.

`JavaScript is case-sensitive, and Math should be used with a capital "M".`

The function using `Array.prototype.reduce()` is a more concise and functional approach to calculating the sum of an array's elements. Let's compare the two methods:

### 1. **Manual Iteration Approach**:

```js
function sum(arr) {
    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        total += arr[i];
    }
    return total;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `let total = 0;` initializes a variable to keep track of the running total.
- **Looping**: `for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++)` iterates over each element in the array.
- **Accumulation**: `total += arr[i];` adds the current element to the running total.
- **Return**: `return total;` returns the computed sum.

### 2. **Using `Array.prototype.reduce()`**:

```js
function sum(arr) {
    return arr.reduce((sum, value) => sum + value, 0);
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **`arr.reduce()`**: The `reduce` method applies a function against an accumulator (`sum` in this case) and each element in the array (`value`), resulting in a single output value (the sum).
- **Callback Function**: `(sum, value) => sum + value` is a callback function passed to `reduce`. It takes two arguments:
  - `sum`: The accumulator that stores the running total.
  - `value`: The current element in the array.
- **Initial Value**: `0` is the initial value for the accumulator (`sum`). It ensures that the first call to the callback function uses this initial value as `sum`.

### Comparison:

1. **Readability**:
   - **Manual Iteration**: More verbose but explicit. It shows each step of the calculation.
   - **`reduce` Method**: More concise and functional. It abstracts away the details of iteration and accumulation.

2. **Performance**:
   - Both methods have similar performance characteristics, but `reduce` might be slightly more optimized in some JavaScript engines due to its functional nature.

3. **Functional Programming**:
   - **Manual Iteration**: Imperative style. You explicitly manage the loop and accumulation.
   - **`reduce` Method**: Declarative style. You describe what you want (sum of the array) without specifying the how of iteration and accumulation.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Both methods assume that the input is a valid array of numbers. Additional error handling (e.g., checking if `arr` is indeed an array) would be required for robustness.

### Example Usage:

For both methods, given an array `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, both will produce the same result:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(sum(arr)); // Outputs: 10
```

### ***Conclusion:***
- Use the **manual iteration approach** if you prefer explicit control over the iteration process.
- Use **`reduce`** if you prefer a more concise and functional style for summing up the elements of an array.

## ***Changes to Lottery Game***
- Make the Lottery tikcets of N digit number
- The Winning sum could be any feasible number

app component(props) âž¡  lottery(props) âž¡ Ticket(props) ðŸ”€ Ticket[0] Ticket[1]
                                                         â†ª  Ticket[2]

In React, the concepts of **Logical Components** (or **Smart Components**) and **Presentational Components** (or **Dumb Components**) refer to a design pattern that separates the logic of an application from its presentation. This pattern helps keep your code organized and improves readability, scalability, and testability.

### 1. ***Logical Components (Smart Components):***
- **Purpose**: Handle application logic, data-fetching, and state management.
- **Characteristics**:
  - They are aware of how the app works.
  - Manage their own state (using hooks like `useState`, `useReducer`, etc.).
  - Often communicate with APIs or services to retrieve data.
  - Can pass state or event handlers (via props) to presentational components.
  - Typically contain less markup and focus on managing behavior.
  
**Example:**
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PresentationalComponent from './PresentationalComponent';

function SmartComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Smart Component</h1>
      <PresentationalComponent count={count} onIncrement={increment} onDecrement={decrement} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default SmartComponent;
```

In this example, the **SmartComponent** manages the state (`count`) and passes it, along with event handlers (`onIncrement`, `onDecrement`), to the presentational component.

---

### 2. ***Presentational Components (Dumb Components):***
- **Purpose**: Render UI based on the props they receive.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Focus on the visual representation.
  - Do not contain any application logic or manage state (except for UI-specific state like toggle switches or form input).
  - Rely on props passed down from the smart component.
  - Can be stateless (functional components).
  - Easier to test since they donâ€™t have much logic.

**Example:**
```jsx
function PresentationalComponent({ count, onIncrement, onDecrement }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Presentational Component</h2>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={onDecrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default PresentationalComponent;
```

In this case, the **PresentationalComponent** does not manage any state of its own. It receives the state (`count`) and handlers (`onIncrement`, `onDecrement`) from the smart component, focusing only on how the UI is displayed.

---

### ***Summary of Differences***:

| **Smart (Logical) Components**                     | **Dumb (Presentational) Components**              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Manages state and logic (e.g., API calls, event handlers). | Focuses on UI and rendering.                     |
| Contains application behavior.                     | Contains very little to no logic.                 |
| Often passes props to presentational components.   | Receives props from smart components.            |
| Can be class or functional components (with hooks). | Typically functional (stateless) components.      |
| Example: Parent component managing business logic. | Example: Child component displaying data/UI.     |

### ***Benefits of this Separation:***
- **Better code organization**: Separation of concerns (logic and presentation).
- **Reusability**: Presentational components can be reused across multiple projects or parts of the app.
- **Testability**: Presentational components are easier to test as they donâ€™t have complex logic.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to logic (business rules) are isolated from changes to the UI, making the code easier to maintain.

### ***Modern Usage in React***:
While the pattern is still useful, with React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and context, many components in modern React applications tend to handle a mix of both logic and UI to some degree. However, keeping components as focused as possible on their core responsibilities (logic or presentation) is still considered a good practice.

```
App âž¡ Lottery(Logical componenet) âž¡ Ticket (Presentational componenet) ðŸ”€ ticket[1] ticket[2] 
                            â†ª  ticket[3]
```
```jsx

          <p style={{fontFamily: 'Luckiest Guy, cursive'}} className='ticket-number'>{isTicket[1]}</p>
          <p style={{fontFamily: 'Luckiest Guy, cursive'}} className='ticket-number'>{isTicket[2]}</p> 
```

## Forms in React
***The standcard way with Forms is to use*** `Controlled Componenets`.***So we make React state to be "single source of truth.***

```Markdown
- In HTML, form element such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and updates it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components and only updated with setState().

- We can combine the two by making the React state to be the "single source of truth". Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happend in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a "controlled component
```

## ***Handling*** `Multiple Inputs`
- ***We create a common handleInputChange() for all elements***

***`evenet.target.name`*** ***changed field***
***`evenet.target.value` new value of the field***

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'

const Form = () => {

    let [isFullName , setFullName] = useState("")
    let [isUsername, setUsername] = useState("")

    

    let handleNameChange = (e)=>{
        setFullName(e.target.value)
        console.log(e.target.value);
    }

    let handleUsernameChange = (e)=>{
        setUsername(e.target.value)
    }// update the value of isFullname and isUsername

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault()
        console.log('Form submitted')
        console.log(`Name: ${isFullName}, Email: ${isUsername}`);
    }

    return (
        <>
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <label htmlFor="fullName">Your Name!</label>
            <input id='fullName' value={isFullName} onChange={handleNameChange} type="text" placeholder='name?' />

            <label htmlFor="username">Your email_id!</label>
            <input id='username' value={isUsername} onChange={handleUsernameChange} type="email" placeholder='email?' />
            <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
        </>
    )

}

export default Form

/* useState is used to manage the state of the component

Form Component
useState for Full Name and Email
handleInputChange for Full Name and Email

```

## ***Validations***
`Formik`
```bash
npm install formik
```
*like the form cannot be empty*

<u>***useEffect***</u>

*The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components*

*Data Fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all example of side effects*
